    <p>I am a 6-4 student in my first semester at MIT. I transfered from Tidewater 
        Community College in Virginia where I earned 2 associate degrees in Computer Science
        and Engineering. Prior to this I spent 10 years in the Navy as a Submarine Nuclear
        Electrical Engineering Technician and as an instructor. I have a wife and a 3-year-old
        son.
